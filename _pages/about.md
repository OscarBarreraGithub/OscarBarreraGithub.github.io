<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). Or any other link. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

### Welcome

<p class="big-text">I'm Oscar Barrera, a PhD student in high-energy theory at Harvard. My research sits at the intersection of physics and machine learning — combining theoretical insight with computational tools to explore how the universe works.</p>

<p class="big-text">Outside of research, I play guitar and, until recently, rode a motorcycle through Florida’s much-missed sunshine.</p>

### About This Site

<p class="big-text">This site is part portfolio, part sandbox.
You’ll find research highlights, side projects, and the occasional physics tangent — the kind of thing that wouldn’t make it into a paper, but still feels worth sharing.</p>
