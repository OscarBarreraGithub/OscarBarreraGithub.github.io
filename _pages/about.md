Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

### Hi, I’m Oscar,

<p class="big-text"> a PhD student in theoretical physics at Harvard University. My work lives at the intersection of high-energy theory and machine learning, where I blend analytical insight with numerical tools to explore some of the most fundamental questions about the universe.</p>

<div class="spacer"></div>

<p class="big-text">I’m currently working with Lisa Randall to numerically constrain flavor-violating processes in five-dimensional Randall–Sundrum models, and with Matt Schwartz to develop efficient algorithms for evaluating Feynman diagrams. In the past, I’ve worked on gravitational wave astrophysics, machine learning for superconductor discovery, and synthetic data generation for financial applications.</p>

<div class="scroll-arrow">↓</div>

<p class="big-text">Outside the lab, I play guitar and grew up on a mix of ’70s rock, ’90s grunge, and 2000s alt. The Interlude tab has the full list of shows I’ve seen.</p>

### About This Site

<p class="big-text">This site is part portfolio, part sandbox.
You’ll find research highlights, side projects, and the occasional physics tangent — the kind of thing that wouldn’t make it into a paper, but still feels worth sharing.</p>
