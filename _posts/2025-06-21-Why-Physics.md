If some guy on the street asks, “Why physics?” you might say: “Well, even if it doesn’t always have direct applications, it builds the tools that let us invent the unimaginable — like GPS, which relies on general relativity.”

But the true purpose of physics isn’t something you can explain to just anyone. It’s only clear to those who have stared at the ceiling at 3 a.m., wondering why anything exists at all. To them, the reason is obvious:

If unraveling the fabric of spacetime, probing the roots of consciousness, or tracing the hidden symmetries of reality doesn’t stir something in you — spiritually or intellectually — then you simply won’t get it.
