It reveals itself in moments of quiet wonder — like staring at the ceiling at 3 a.m., haunted by the question of why anything exists at all. For those who’ve felt that weight, the urge to probe the laws of nature isn’t just curiosity — it’s a need to make sense of existence itself.</p> <p class="big-text">If unraveling the fabric of spacetime, probing the roots of consciousness, or tracing the hidden symmetries of reality doesn’t stir something in you — spiritually or intellectually— then maybe the better question is: what does?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[If a stranger were to ask, “Why physics?” you might say: “Well, even if it doesn’t always have direct applications, it builds the tools that let us invent the unimaginable — like GPS, which relies on general relativity.”]]></summary></entry></feed>
